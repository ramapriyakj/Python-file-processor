Steps to run the code:
----------------------
1. Open two termial instances (A and B) pointing to the folder containing this file (let us say readme.md is under ~/simplaex_file_processor/)
2. Run the following command in termial A:
python simplaex_file_processor.py
3. Run the following command in termial B:
java -jar producer.jar --tcp
4. Stop both terminals to view the results. The results will be under the result folder (~/simplaex_file_processor/result/)
